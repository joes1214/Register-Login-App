# You need to create an app that allows users to register and to login into the system. The focus of this project is to create an app with several activities and has data validation.

## You should have:

* A welcome screen (splash screen) with your app name and a picture.
* You should then move to a screen that asks the user for either to log in or to register.
* If the user clicks to register then show a registration page with fields for at least first name, family name, date of birth, email, and a password.
* Validate that the entered data is not empty.
* Check that the entered data is correct (such as email validation, first name should at least 3 char and not more than 30)
* If registration is successful return to the previous screen.
* Enable login (it doesnâ€™t have to be linked to a database at this stage)
* You need to add comments to your code (Java and XML).
* You need to have a nice design.
* Make sure that you test your app at least on two different devices (phone and tablet) and for portrait and landscape modes.
